# Deployment Guide - 3D Aim Trainer

## Vercel Deployment Optimization

This project has been optimized for deployment on Vercel with the following features:

### Build Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Three.js and managers are split into separate chunks for better caching
- **Minification**: Terser minification with console.log removal in production
- **Asset Optimization**: Images and assets are optimized and cached with immutable headers
- **Modern Browser Targeting**: ES2020 target for better performance
- **CSS Code Splitting**: Separate CSS chunks for optimal loading

### Caching Strategy

The `vercel.json` configuration implements aggressive caching:

- **Static Assets**: 1 year cache with immutable headers (`/assets/*`)
- **Media Files**: 1 year cache for images, fonts, and other static resources
- **HTML Files**: No cache to ensure fresh content delivery

### Performance Features

- **Module Preloading**: Critical chunks are preloaded for faster initial load
- **Asset Inlining**: Small assets (< 4KB) are inlined as base64
- **Compression**: Automatic gzip/brotli compression via Vercel
- **CDN**: Global CDN distribution through Vercel Edge Network

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite framework
3. Build and deployment will happen automatically on push

### 2. Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Build the project
npm run build:verify

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Local Testing

```bash
# Build and verify
npm run build:verify

# Test locally
npm run preview
```

## Build Verification

The project includes a build verification script that checks:

- ✅ Required files are present
- ✅ Asset chunks are properly generated
- ✅ File sizes are within reasonable limits
- ✅ HTML optimizations are applied

Run verification:
```bash
npm run verify-build
```

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance characteristics:

- **Initial Load**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5 seconds
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: 
  - Main chunk: ~27KB (gzipped: ~7.6KB)
  - Three.js chunk: ~479KB (gzipped: ~116KB)
  - Managers chunk: ~20KB (gzipped: ~5.6KB)
  - CSS: ~6KB (gzipped: ~1.6KB)

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for deployment.

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. **Terser not found**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to identify issues
3. **Asset loading issues**: Check that all imports use relative paths

### Performance Issues

1. **Large bundle size**: Check for unnecessary imports in the codebase
2. **Slow loading**: Verify CDN is working and assets are properly cached
3. **Memory issues**: Monitor Three.js object disposal in production

### Deployment Issues

1. **404 errors**: Ensure `vercel.json` rewrites are configured correctly
2. **CORS issues**: Check that all assets are served from the same domain
3. **Cache issues**: Use hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to bypass browser cache

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Core Web Vitals in Google PageSpeed Insights
- Error rates in browser console
- Performance metrics in Vercel Analytics
- User engagement and session duration

## Security

The deployment includes security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## Future Optimizations

Potential improvements for future versions:

- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- WebAssembly for performance-critical calculations
- Advanced texture compression for 3D assets
