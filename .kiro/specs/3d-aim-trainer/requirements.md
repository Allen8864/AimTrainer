# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A pure frontend 3D aim trainer web application that provides users with an interactive 3D environment to practice their aiming skills. The application will be simple, easy to use, and deployable to Vercel. It features a 3D environment with targets and includes a scoring system that tracks performance during gameplay sessions without requiring data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the aim trainer immediately when I visit the website, so that I can start practicing without any setup or registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL load the 3D aim trainer interface within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a simple start button or interface to begin training
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL NOT require any user registration or login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a 3D environment for aim training using a USP pistol, so that I can practice my targeting skills in a realistic setting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the training starts THEN the system SHALL render a 3D environment with targets and a USP pistol as the default weapon
2. WHEN I move my mouse THEN the system SHALL update the crosshair or aiming reticle position smoothly
3. WHEN I click on a target THEN the system SHALL register a hit with USP firing mechanics and provide visual feedback
4. WHEN I miss a target THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback
5. WHEN targets are hit THEN the system SHALL spawn new targets to maintain continuous gameplay
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use only the USP pistol without weapon selection options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my performance tracked with a scoring system, so that I can monitor my improvement and stay motivated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hit a target THEN the system SHALL increase my score based on accuracy and timing
2. WHEN I miss a target THEN the system SHALL track missed shots
3. WHEN I am playing THEN the system SHALL display current score, accuracy percentage, and time elapsed
4. WHEN a training session ends THEN the system SHALL show final statistics including total score, accuracy, and targets hit
5. WHEN I start a new session THEN the system SHALL reset the score to zero

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work smoothly across different devices and browsers, so that I can practice anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application on desktop browsers THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality with mouse controls
2. WHEN I access the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch controls
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS for smooth gameplay
4. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN the system SHALL adjust the 3D viewport accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be easily deployable to Vercel, so that it can be hosted and accessed publicly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate static files compatible with Vercel deployment
2. WHEN deployed to Vercel THEN the system SHALL load and function correctly in the production environment
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without errors and optimize assets for web delivery
4. WHEN accessed via the deployed URL THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as local development

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive controls and clear visual feedback, so that I can focus on improving my aim without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions on how to play
2. WHEN I interact with targets THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual and audio feedback
3. WHEN targets appear THEN the system SHALL make them clearly visible and distinguishable from the background
4. WHEN I pause or want to restart THEN the system SHALL provide easily accessible controls
5. WHEN the game is active THEN the system SHALL display all relevant information (score, time, accuracy) in a non-intrusive way

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust mouse sensitivity settings, so that I can customize the aiming experience to match my preferences and hardware setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the settings THEN the system SHALL provide a mouse sensitivity slider or input field
2. WHEN I adjust the sensitivity setting THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the changes to mouse movement
3. WHEN I change sensitivity THEN the system SHALL save the setting for the current browser session
4. WHEN the sensitivity is set THEN the system SHALL provide a reasonable default value that works for most users
5. WHEN I test different sensitivity levels THEN the system SHALL provide smooth and responsive mouse tracking at all settings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want audio feedback during gameplay, so that I can have a more immersive and responsive training experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I fire the USP pistol THEN the system SHALL play a realistic gunshot sound effect
2. WHEN I hit a target THEN the system SHALL play a distinct hit confirmation sound
3. WHEN I miss a target THEN the system SHALL play a subtle miss feedback sound
4. WHEN I achieve score milestones or streaks THEN the system SHALL play appropriate audio cues
5. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL provide volume controls for audio feedback
6. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL provide an audio on/off toggle switch
7. WHEN audio is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally without sound
8. WHEN I toggle audio off THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all audio feedback
9. WHEN I toggle audio back on THEN the system SHALL resume audio feedback with the previously set volume level

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform optimally across different hardware configurations, so that I can have a smooth and consistent training experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect device capabilities and adjust rendering quality accordingly
2. WHEN running on lower-end hardware THEN the system SHALL maintain playable frame rates by reducing visual effects if necessary
3. WHEN the frame rate drops below 30 FPS THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize rendering settings
4. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL use efficient compression and caching strategies
5. WHEN memory usage increases during extended play THEN the system SHALL manage resources to prevent performance degradation
6. WHEN the browser tab becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL reduce resource usage to preserve system performance
